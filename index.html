                    Batesburg-Leesville Animal Hospital has always been known
                    in the community as a warm and welcoming pet clinic with
                    amazing and friendly staff, and expert services.
                    It is our mission to treat each pet as if they are a member
                    of our own family.

            <h2>What to Expect</h2>
            <p>
    
                As a new client of our practice, you can expect our full attention to your pets' needs.  Our service will be provided with courtesy and respect. <br/>
            <p>   
                When you arrive for your appointment, you will be greeted warmly, and we will usher you into an examination room as soon as we have one available.  Our goal is to see all of our clients and patients on time, and although we have contingencies for emergencies, there will be times where the unexpected will create delays. We will ensure these are minimized as much as possible. <br/>
            </p>
            <p>    
                You will normally see a Veterinary Technician or Assistant first who will take a history, and gather some data for the doctor.  A veterinarian will see you next, examine your pet, answer your questions and plan further diagnostics or treatment as necessary.  You will normally see the Veterinary Technician or Assistant again to wrap things up, and she will provide you with further
                educational information and answer routine wellness and care questions for you.  Our client care specialists will handle billing and schedule any needed follow up. <br/>
            </p>
            <p>     
                We are excited to meet you and your human and animal family members!
